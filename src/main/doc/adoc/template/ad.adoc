=== AP1 - Solution should be generic

Solution provided in this document should be valid for any product pulled from Workflow Tools system.

Although all products are different, they all consist of similar processing pipeline: pull, enrich, validate, transform, make client projections and send it to the client.
We want solution that will work for any product with minium amount of customization to foster fast delivery of new products.

== Architectural design decisions
****
* List and describe key design decisions
** Give rationale for each decision, document alternatives considered and explain why they were rejected
****

=== AD1 - Data pulled from WFT will be grouped by (Company ID, Reporting Year) tuple

Unique record identifier for all products shall be Company ID and Reporting Year.
All data needed for manipulating particular record will reside within that record.

It is easier to implement quality checks and transformation rules if all data needed for a computation is within the record.
